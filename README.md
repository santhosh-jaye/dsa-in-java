## Data structure and types of data structure

Data -> Information <br/>
Structure -> Arrangement of data in computers <br/>

We select the data structure based on the application <br/>
Helps in better memory and CPU utilization. <br/>

### Types of Data structure

1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-linear Data Structure

**1. Linear Data Structure**

- Data is arranged in sequential manner.
- Every element has neighbours - left and right
- They have predefined extremes
- Eg: Arrays

**2. Non-linear Data Structure**
